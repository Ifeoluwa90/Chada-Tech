## Project Overview

This repository contains my work for the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course, focusing on the SNHU Travel project. The project involved developing a travel booking software using Scrum-Agile methodologies.

## Interpreting User Needs

Throughout the SNHU Travel project, I learned to effectively interpret and implement user needs through:

- **User Stories**: Framing features from the user's perspective
- **Focus on Value**: Ensuring development efforts deliver real value to end-users
- **Breaking Down Requirements**: Translating complex needs into manageable tasks

Example User Story:
This approach helped maintain focus on user goals throughout the development process.

## Agile Processes in Development

Key Agile processes I plan to incorporate in future work:

1. **Sprint Planning**: Breaking projects into manageable chunks
2. **Daily Stand-ups**: Fostering communication and quick problem-solving
3. **Continuous Integration and Testing**: Catching and fixing issues early
4. **Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives**: Facilitating regular feedback and improvement

These processes not only improved software quality but also enhanced team collaboration and responsiveness to changing requirements.

## Being a Good Team Member

Through various roles in the project, I identified key qualities of a good team member in software development:

- **Effective Communication**: Clearly expressing ideas and actively listening
- **Collaboration**: Working closely with team members and sharing knowledge
- **Adaptability**: Adjusting to changing requirements and new information
- **Responsibility**: Taking ownership of tasks and being accountable
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying open to new ideas and technologies

## Additional Insights

### Flexibility in Software Development
- Adapting to changes (e.g., pivoting from list-based interface to slideshow)
- Handling unforeseen changes without derailing the project

### Continuous Feedback
- Importance of user and team feedback
- Regular assessment and adjustment through sprint reviews and stand-ups

### Balancing Skills
- Importance of both technical and soft skills
- Cultivating a well-rounded skill set

### Tools and Processes
- Hands-on experience with Agile tools (Product Backlog, User Stories, Test Cases)
- Understanding the principles behind the tools

### Ethical Considerations
- Awareness of data privacy, accessibility, and software impact
- Responsibility in software development

## Artifact

The main artifact for this project is the Sprint Review and Retrospective document, which summarizes the Agile and Scrum practices applied throughout the course. This document reflects on:

- The effectiveness of Scrum roles
- How user stories facilitated development
- The team's ability to handle project changes
- The impact of Agile tools and principles on project success

## Looking Forward

As I progress in my software development career, I aim to:
- Refine Agile practices
- Stay open to new methodologies
- Keep end-users at the center of the development process
- Continue learning and adapting to industry changes

This project has provided a strong foundation, emphasizing the importance of user-centric design, agile methodologies, and effective teamwork in creating successful software projects.
